# Test scripts for CSE201A

To run this project: 

1. Clone the repo or download the source code. If cloning, please make sure to switch over to the branch called `version3`. That is the most up to date branch. That can be done by running the command `git checkout version`

2. Run the test cases with the command `./test.sh`. This will execute the arith executable made with pyinstaller. 

3. To manually run the test cases, use the command `make`. 

NOTE: When running the test cases, the program will ask for user standard input. You can type in a dummy test case like `4 + 7` or just press `CMD` and `D` and the test script will continue as normal.




These test scripts are prepared based on [Sohum Banerjea's work](https://github.com/SohumB/cse210A-asgtest/tree/master).
